# WeatherApp-QWidget-
This is a weather app built using Python and PyQt5 that allows users to check the current weather of any city in real-time. By simply entering a city name, the app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the temperature, a short description of the weather, and even an emoji that matches the conditions.â€‹
